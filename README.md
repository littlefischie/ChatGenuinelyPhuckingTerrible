This is better than ChatGPT, totally better, finally an AI that gives you kinda sorta maybe what you were searching for if you're lucky.

To make this work you'll have to download `simplewiki-latest-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2` from `https://dumps.wikimedia.org/simplewiki/latest/` then run text processor. You'll also have to change the path to your downloaded .bz2 within `txt_processor.py` and the output to the project directory as it's currently just set for my machine. Same goes for within `GenuinelyPhuckingTerrible.py`

Good luck!
